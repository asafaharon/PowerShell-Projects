# Malware Scanner Tool with Summary and HTML Report

This project is a **Malware Scanner Tool** developed in PowerShell. It scans files in a specified directory for potentially malicious files based on their extensions and size. The tool provides a detailed summary of the scan and generates an HTML report for easy viewing.

## Features
1. **Graphical Folder Selection**:
   - The user can select any folder on the system to be scanned using a graphical interface.

2. **Real-Time Progress Display**:
   - The tool displays a real-time progress bar in the PowerShell console, showing the percentage of files scanned.

3. **Flagging Suspicious Files**:
   - Files are flagged as suspicious if they meet one of the following criteria:
     - Have a potentially dangerous extension (`.exe`, `.bat`, `.ps1`, `.vbs`, `.dll`).
     - Are larger than a specified size (default: 100 MB).

4. **Detailed Summary**:
   - At the end of the scan, a summary is displayed in the console, including:
     - Total number of files scanned.
     - Number of files flagged as suspicious.

5. **HTML Report Generation**:
   - An HTML report is generated, containing:
     - Summary of the scan.
     - List of all flagged files, including their paths and reasons for being flagged.

6. **Automatic Report Opening**:
   - The HTML report is automatically opened in the default web browser upon completion of the scan.

## How to Use
1. **Run the Script**:
   - Open PowerShell **as Administrator**.
   - Navigate to the directory containing the script.
     ```powershell
     cd "C:\path\to\script"
     ```
   - Run the script:
     ```powershell
     .\MalwareScannerTool.ps1
     ```

2. **Select Folder**:
   - When prompted, a folder selection dialog will appear.
   - Select the folder you want to scan and click **OK**.

3. **View Results**:
   - Once the scan is complete:
     - A summary will be displayed in the PowerShell console.
     - An HTML report will be saved in the same directory as the script and automatically opened in the default web browser.

## Example Output
**Console Output:**
```
Starting scan on: C:\Users\asafa\Documents
Scan completed successfully!
Total Files Scanned: 5000
Flagged Files: 10
HTML report saved at: C:\path\to\MalwareScanReport_20250107_101500.html
```

**HTML Report:**
The HTML report will display a summary and a table of flagged files, including their full paths and reasons for being flagged.

## Customization
- **Change Suspicious Extensions**:
  - You can modify the `$suspiciousExtensions` array in the script to include additional extensions.
- **Change Maximum File Size**:
  - You can adjust the `$maxFileSizeMB` variable to change the threshold for large files.

## Limitations
- The tool may not scan some system directories if run without administrator privileges.
- Files that require special permissions to access will be skipped unless the script is run as Administrator.
